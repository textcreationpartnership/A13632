            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>CHriſtian and Religious Reader, this treatiſe was compiled for thy good, and is very neceſſary for theſe Prepoſterous times, wherein are ſuch ſound Proofes handled, which is to the overthrow of Popiſh errours and ſchiſmaticall ſuperſtition, and tends to the mainetenance of true Proteſtancye with their faith and quality therof.</p>
            <p>Faith in holy Scripture is taken either for the quality and habit of Faith, or for the doctrine of Faith. The holy Scripture deciphereth the quality and habit of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:652:5"/> Faith by arguments taken out of all Theologicall places as followeth.</p>
            <p>The principall efficient cauſe of the quality or habit of Faith, is God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 29. The inſtrumentall cauſe is the word of God, <hi>Rom</hi> 10. 17. The material cauſe is an aſſent vpon knowledge, <hi>Ioh,</hi> 6. 69.

The effects of Faith are, as all other divine graces and fruits of the ſpirit, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. ſo an holy conſidence, and an aſſurance of God's loue, and a comfortable boldneſſe to come vnto God as vnto a gracious and loving Father, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 12. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10. The ſubiect wherin it is ſeated, is the mind.

            <p>The doctrines of Faith, ſet down in the bookes of the Prophets and Apoſtles, are Logicall, reaſonable &amp; wiſe; and the very firſt principles and grounds thereof are <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 2</note> without any mixture of ſophiſticall deceit.

The Church is our Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, and Chriſt himſelfe is our Schoolmaſter; and the Bible is the Booke whereby we be taught: corrections are the rod in Chriſts hands, whereby we are forced to giue an attentiue eare to the inſtructions of his word, by the which we are made wiſe and learned Chriſtians.</p>

And therefore it is a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall bleſſing of God, when by proſperity we are ſtirred vp to thankfulnes, and by aduerſity to repentance, and to take better heed to the wholeſome inſtructions of God's moſt holy word. Bleſſed is the man (ſaid <hi>Dauid)</hi> whom thou chaſtneſt, O Lord, and teacheſt in thy Law, that thou maiſt giue him patience in <note place="margin">Pſal. 94. 12.</note>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:652:16"/> time of adverſity, vntill the pit be digged for the vngodly.</p>
                  <p>And verily when in our aduerſity the Lord doth teach vs out of his Word the vſe and end of afflictions, and maketh vs ſeriouſly to lay it to our hearts, then is our adverſity made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable vnto vs by the bleſſing of God. I heard <hi>Ephraim</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) lamenting thus; Thou haſt corrected me, and I was chaſtiſed as an vntamed Calfe, convert thou me, and I ſhalbe converted, for thou art the Lord my God. Surely after I converted, I repented; and after I was inſtructed, I ſmote vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Ier. 31. 18.</note> my thigh. In which words we may perceiue that correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of themſelues cauſe the profeſſed ſeruants of God to kicke with the heele, and that vntill God by his word inſtruct them, they are not effectually moued by their corrections vnto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and amendment of life. Wherefore when the Lord o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth the eares of any of his Seruants by their corrections, it is by ſending vnto them a Meſſenger one of a thouſand to declare vnto them the Lord's moſt exact righteouſnes and ſeuerity e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen againſt the ſinne of his Elect, which cannot be ſatisfied for the ſame but by the precious Bloud of their Sauior Chriſt, that thereby they might be brought to Faith and Repentance. For then will the Lord haue mercy vpon them, and ſay, Deliuer them, that they goe not downe into the pit; for I haue receiued a reconciliation. <note place="margin">Iob 33. 24.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>So then it is ſtill the power of the Goſpell of Chriſt, ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the mouthes of his faithfull Miniſters, that is able to worke the converſion of a ſinner: afflictions may cauſe vs more carefully to giue attendance to the Word, as in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner may pai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Not that any can be forced to faith and repentance by any manner of penalty or paine whatſoeuer, but by inforcements they may be driuen to come to the Aſſemblies of the Saints, where the Fiſhers of men caſt out the net of the Goſpell, that at one time or other they may be brought within the compaſſe thereof, and ſo may be taken vp into <hi>Noah's</hi> Arke. So then ſtill
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:652:17"/> it is the net of the Goſpell, and the hooke of the Word, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men are taken and brought vnto God: afflictions ſent of God, and penalties inflicted by the Magiſtrates, are but the baites to make ſome bite at this hooke, and poles to make them come within the compaſſe of this net.</p>

                  <p>The moſt that the Law of God can effect either by the ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the holy precepts thereof, or by the ſeuerity of the threatnings denounced therein, is happily for a time to ſtay ſin, vndoubtedly it hath not power enough to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So the Emperour <hi>Adrian</hi> in his reſcript: credit is to be giuen to him that giueth the teſtimony, and not to the bare teſtimony: And verely we doe not embrace the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of God ſet downe in the bookes of the Scriptures with that reuerent manner as we ought to doe, vnleſſe when wee giue aſſent thereunto, we dee it not ſo much for the bare te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony it ſelfe, as for that it is the teſtimony of the moſt wiſe and holy God, which cannot deceiue or be deceiued: F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>r then we rightly honour him and his truth. Hereof it was that Chriſt receiued not the witneſſe of <hi>Iohn,</hi> as it was the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny proceeding from a meere man: but he receiued it as the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony <note place="margin">Ioh. 5. 33.</note> of ſuch a man as was indued with the Spirit of <hi>Eliah,</hi>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:652:27"/> and ſent before himſelfe to prepare his way. Nay, he ſaith of his owne bare and naked teſtimony conſidered by it ſelfe; If I ſhould beare witneſſe of my ſelfe, my witneſſe were not true. <note place="margin">Ioh 5. 31.</note> And yet concerning the ſame, as it is the teſtimony of the Son of God, the very eſſentiall wiſedome of his heauenly Father, he ſaith, though I beare record of my ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>lfe, my record is true: <note place="margin">Ioh. 8. 14.</note> for I know whence I came, and whither I goe. And hereof it is, that both God and Chriſt are ſo often mentioned in the holy Scripture with their honourable Titles, that ſo the credibility of their perſons, may yeeld the more and greater credit to their Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Andy et as if this were not ſufficient inough, the very do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine it ſelfe that proceedeth from God, and is ſet downe in the holy Scripture, is cleared and iuſtified by many arguments and reaſons. And verily how otherwiſe could the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture inable the wiſe and learned profeſſors of the Chriſtian Faith, to confute all Heatheniſh and haereticall errours, and to iuſtifie all Divine and Heauenly Truthes, not onely to the Gentiles, and Haeretickes, but alſo to the faithfull themſelues, vnleſſe it did miniſter plenty of all ſound and evident argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the effecting of the ſame? The Gentiles refuſe the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry words of the Canonicall Scriptures, and the Haeretickes reiect the right and orthodoxall ſenſe of them; and therefore neither of them can be convicted, but by the euidence of reaſon: yea, how can the faithfull themſelues giue a ſure aſſent vnto the Doctrines of the holy Scriptures, vnleſſe they apprehend ſuch arguments and reaſons, as are ſufficient motiues to induce them thereunto? And hereof it is, that in all ſound and Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxe Sermons, made either to breed, or to encreaſe and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Faith vnto the doctrines obſerued in the words of the Text: there are annexed ſound and ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for the opening and confirming of the ſame doctrines. And this is the cauſe why preaching is preferred before rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and Catechiſing, as being the more ordinary meanes both to beget and ſtrengthen Faith; for that in preaching many reaſons are produced as many lights for the better clearing and iuſtifying of all Truthes, and for the fuller convincing of all

                  <p>There is, I confeſſe, no efficient cauſe of Gods will, but his will it ſelfe: for there is nothing without God that maketh him to will or to worke: for then God ſhould not be the firſt mouer, and the firſt cauſe of all things; but therefore he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 19.</note> becauſe he willeth. And yet farre be it from any Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heart, to thinke that the moſt wiſe God, willeth any thing without good and ſufficient reaſon; or that he ſpeaketh any thing idlely, or in vaine. The Word of the Lord, is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 1. 5.</note> of Wiſedome: and therefore openeth all Divine truthes by their right and proper reaſons.

And although they goe neuer ſo contrary a way all the day long, yet ſuch admirable and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring guides they are, that at night they are ſtill right, and at the place where they ſhould be.</p>
                  <p>But the Lord requireth of all ſuch as ſhould be paſtours and feeders of his ſlocke, and inſtructers and teachers of his people, that they be not young nouices, and raw ſchollers, <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 6.</note> but ancient Students, and well grounded Diuines; euen ſuch as are able to teach truth and conuince errour: they muſt be learned Scribes in the Kingdome of God, able to bring out of their treaſury both new and old. Yea, it is very fit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient that they haue skill in prophane learning, that they may wound the enemy with his own weapon, &amp; cut off <hi>Goliahs</hi> head with his owne ſword, and build vp the Temple of God with ſome ſtuffe taken out of the ruines of Babylon: For (as Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith) it is no ſmall praiſe and commendation, to <note place="margin">

                  <p>And verily, <hi>Moſes</hi> being learned in all the wiſdome of the Aegyptians, was thereby made mighty in words and deeds, or at the leaſt was not a little holpen thereby in all his great
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:652:36"/> and weighty affaires. As <hi>Daniel</hi> being inſtructed in all wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, <note place="margin">Dan. 1. 17.</note> and being taught the tongue and learning of the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans, became ten times wiſer than all the Inchanters and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologians of Babylon, and was alſo ſtrengthened and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the feare and ſeruice of the true God, more than any other that liued in his time. And did not our Sauiour Chriſt giue to his Apoſtles, the firſt Preachers and Publiſhers of his Goſpell in all the world, by the immediate worke of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <note place="margin">Act. 4. 13.</note> (for they were by education ſimple and vnlearned) ſuch a <note place="margin">Luke 21. 15.</note> mouth and wiſdome, that all their aduerſaries were not able to reſiſt? And did he not alſo giue to the firſt renewers and reuiuers of the Goſpell in theſe latter dayes, ſuch knowledge in the tongues, and in all manner of Diuine and humane lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, by bleſſing their great labours and paines, in the diligent vſing of the meanes for the obtaining thereof, that thereby they became moſt notable lights throughout all the Countreys and Kingdomes of Chriſtendome? For they which haue the greateſt light in themſelues, are the fitteſt perſons to lighten others; and they that beſt apprehend the grounds and reaſons of all humane and diuine verities, can beſt informe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme others in all manner of doctrines, both humane and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine. As it may appeare by the parable of the Talents, where <note place="margin">Matth. 25. 16.</note> it is aſſumed, that he that receiued fiue Talents, went and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied with them, and gained other fiue, as he that receiued two gained other two.</p>
                  <p>And yet it may not be denied, but that it may come to paſſe, that he that hath the meaner gifts, may doe the more good, and ſometimes perſwade with more fruit. As in the Councell of Nice, when all the learned Biſhops could not <note place="margin">

For as all the lights in the world cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect vs in our way, if we our ſelues be blinde and want our ſight; or as all the medicines in the world cannot reſtore health, if that our diſeaſed ſtomackes will not receiue them ſo the light of Gods word, be it neuer ſo cleerely and neuer ſo directly ſet before vs, cannot guide vs to God as long as we remaine in our naturall blindneſſe, and ſhut our eyes againſt the ſame. Neither can all the balme of Gilead cure our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall <note place="margin">Iere. 8. 22.</note> ſores, if that we will not indure to haue it applied vnto them.</p>
                  <p>All meanes are nothing be they neuer ſo good, without the ſpeciall bleſſing of God; as on the contrary ſide, when it <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 7.</note> ſhall pleaſe God to bleſſe the meanes, they ſhall preuaile be they neuer ſo meane. And verily, as in bodily wars it is as eaſie with God to ſaue with few as with many (albeit ordinarily the ſtrongeſt army, &amp; the beſt furniſhed, winneth the field and getteth the victory) ſo in our ſpirituall warfare againſt infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſuperſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

As it is manifeſt in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, who for that they were indued with the greateſt meaſure of all diuine and heauenly wiſedome, conuerted more to the faith of Chriſt then any other of their ſucceſſours.</p>
                  <p>As did likewiſe thoſe principall men, which were in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:652:37"/> vnto the which milke doth better agree then ſtrong meat: and in the dimneſſe of the ſpirituall eye, which can ſee better with a little light then with a great, or in the extraordinary worke of God. For ordinarily, the greater number and the bigger lights doe giue the greater and bigger light, as the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſtronger food doth yeeld the better and ſtronger nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore the Preachers of the word of God being the Lords ſtewards, and the diſpoſers of the myſteries of God, who are therefore ſet ouer the Lords houſe, that they ſhou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

As likewiſe for that they are the Lords Captaines to marſhall his bands and companies againſt the Lords and their owne enemies, they ought to be furniſhed with all manner of ſpirituall armour, that ſo they may be able to furniſh other. And verily, for any one to take vpon him to diſcourſe and reaſon without ſound and apt reaſons, and to argue without ſubſtantiall and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent arguments, is to take vpon him to feed without food, to fight without weapon, to lighten a thing without light, and to build without morter, timber, and ſtone.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore the moſt wiſe God hath moſt prudently proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the moſt plentifull inſtruction both of Prieſt and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, not only by ſetting downe in his two bookes of nature and grace, all doctrines neceſſary for their ſaluation, with great variety of all manner of reaſons and arguments, for the better clearing and confirming of the ſame; but alſo by often repeating and inculcating of them: yea, by vrging them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine and againe; he hath giuen them a plaine admonition, that they ſhould be moſt diligent to learne thoſe thing, ouer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine and againe, which he hath beene ſo carefull ſo often to teach.

For becauſe we are blinde to conceiue, and flow to beleeue, and hard to learne, and ready to forget the holy myſteries of piety and godlines: therefore the Lord hath cauſed not onely doctrines, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and arguments to be ſet downe at once in the booke of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:652:38"/> the diuine Scriptures, but he hath made them to be reitterated againe and againe, that thereby they may become lights to our vnderſtanding, ſtayes to our faith, and helps to our fraile and weake memory. So that albeit we are by nature neuer ſo dull and blockiſh, yet the ſame leſſons being often repeated, and opened, and cleered againe and againe, we ſhall be thereby en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled by Gods bleſſing, ſufficiently to conceiue, and faithfully keepe them in good remembrance. <hi>Pharaohs</hi> dreames were <note place="margin">Gen. 41. 32.</note> doubled vnto him, that the thing opened therein might get of him the better credit, ſo the inſtructions of faith, and an holy life are doubled and trebled in holy Scripture, that they might procure of vs a fuller faith. So and ſo good is our gracious God vnto vs, which are ſo and ſo vnworthy of the leaſt of his mercies, that as he hath ſtored the earth with great variety of bodily food and phyſicke, for the preſeruing and recouering of the life &amp; health of our bodies; ſo he hath prouided in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures great abundance of ſpirituall food and phyſicke for the maintenance and reſtitution of the life and health of our ſoules.</p>
                  <p>One kinde of bodily food, and one kinde of dreſſing doth not ſauour alike to euery ſtomacke, and therefore God hath prouided variety of both: ſo one motiue to faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, nor the deliuery thereof after one manner doth fit euery ones ſpirituall taſte and ſtomacke, therefore hath the Lord or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained great abundance of both. Yea, as the Lord gaue ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry ſignes and wonders to be done by the hands of his ſeruant <hi>Moſes</hi> before the eies of the children of Iſrael, that therby they <note place="margin">Exod. 4. 8.</note> might vnderſtand that he was called &amp; ſent of God to be their deliuerer out of the bondage of Aegypt, &amp; that to this very end and purpoſe, that if they would not beleeue nor obey the voice of the firſt ſigne, yet they might be induced thereto ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the ſecond or the third: So doth the Lord furniſh the Preachers of the Goſpell, whom he hath appointed to bee miniſters of his mercy, for the deliuerance of his people out of the ſpirituall captiuity of ſinne and Satan, with great variety of forcible and powerfull motiues and perſwaſions to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and faith, that if ſome of the ſame will not worke and preuaile with them, yet other may.</p>

So he likewiſe proueth, that the faithfull ought not to ſeeke for life and ſaluation by the works of the Law, ſeeing <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 15.</note> God hath couenanted to giue it to them in Chriſt Ieſus: ſeeing to a mans couenant or teſtament, when it is once made, nothing ought to be added or detracted from the ſame; much leſſe to the Couenant of God. So our Sauiour teacheth, that they are <note place="margin">Matth. 13. 23.</note> the holy doctrines of his good and gratious Word, that cauſeth our hearts to be good and gracious, euen as it is pure and good feed, that maketh the ground bring forth pure and good fruit. And verily, our bleſſed Sauiour did illuſtrate with parables all <note place="margin">Matth. 13. 34</note> his diuine inſtructions which he gaue vnto the people, as being the beſt meanes to bring them to the knowledge of the truth, and to their euerlaſting ſaluation, which is procured thereby.

Wherefore our bleſſed Sauiour and his Apoſtles vſed often parables and reſemblances taken from earthly things, for the better manifeſting of their heauenly doctrines, and other like arguments alſo, taken out of the booke of nature, well knowne to euery intelligent man, that is found and entire in his outward ſenſes.

And when <hi>Thomas</hi> would <note place="margin">Luke 24. 39.</note> not yet beleeue the teſtimony of his fellow Apoſtles, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the reſurrection of Chriſt; when he appeared vnto them againe, he ſpake vnto <hi>Thomas</hi> ſaying, put thy finger here and ſee my hands, and ſtretch foorth thy hand and put it into my ſide, and be not faithleſſe but beleeue: The which thing when <note place="margin">Iohn 20. 28.</note>

                     </gap>aire, the Apoſtle to redreſſe the ſame, appealeth to the iudgment of nature it ſelfe; ſaying, What, doth not nature it ſelfe teach you, that it is a ſhame for a man to haue long haire? So our bleſſed Sauiour, to perſwade
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:652:39"/> his Diſciples to doe good to their very enemies, ſaith, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth teach the Gentiles themſelues to be good to their friends, and that Chriſtians being aduanced aboue them by <note place="margin">Matth. 5. 45.</note> grace, ſhould learne thereby to doe good to their enemies; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially ſeeing that ſenſe and experience did plainly teach them, that God maketh his Sunne to riſe on the euill and on the good, and his raine to fall on the iuſt and vniuſt. Wherefore errours may be confuted, and faith and piety perſwaded, not onely by arguments taken out of the booke of grace, but alſo out of the booke of nature. For neither ſenſe nor reaſon, are contrary to religion, or enemies to faith; nay rather right reaſon is a moſt faſt friend to faith, and a moſt valiant Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion for true Religion.</p>
                  <p>But yet here this moſt reaſonable caution muſt be added, that when queſtion is of the extraordinary and ſupernaturall workes of God, we take not vpon v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> to meaſure them with the ſhort line of naturall reaſon, ſeeing that is not able to reach vnto the height, or to found the depth thereof. And therefore <hi>Sarah</hi> and <hi>Zachary</hi> cannot be excuſed, in that when a childe <note place="margin">Gen. 18. 11.</note> was promi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Whereas the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> in a caſe more improbable, caſt her eyes vpon the power of the promiſer, and ſo ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Luke 1. 49.</note> his holy name. As <hi>Abraham</hi> alſo in the former caſe, doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting not through vnbeleefe, but reſting fully aſſured that he that promiſed him a childe would and could performe it, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified God aboue that hope that nature could yeeld, but vnder that hope that God which is ſupernaturall, is able to ſatisfie <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 19.</note> to the full. Wherefore it is not impoſſible by reaſon, to aſcend aboue reaſon, and by the principles of an higher ſcience, to haue that ſelfe-ſame thing confirmed for a truth, which by the grounds of an inferiour Art cannot be proued.</p>
                  <p>Neither is faith it ſelfe then moſt commendable, when ſhe hath feweſt reaſons to aſſiſt her, for then the Colliers faith
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:652:40"/> were better then the wiſe hearted Chriſtians, and the learners better then the teachers: yea to grow from faith to faith by growing from knowledge to knowledge, were to grow from the better to the worſe; much leſſe when ſhe is reſiſted with all the forces thereof. The truth is, that faith is neuer at open warre; no not ſo much as at the leaſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>arre with true reaſon, neither is ſhe at any time thereby reſiſted, but continually aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with all her might. Yea, to ſay that faith is contrary to reaſon, is to ſay, that the ſight is contrary to the light where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it ſeeth, and that an houſe is contrary to the foundation whereon it is built; Nay, rather we may truly auouch, that where there is no reaſon conceiued, there is no light to make manifeſt the truth, nor motiue to perſwade to faith, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no truth nor faith at all. As likewiſe, where there is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon only in ſhew and not in ſubſtance, there is a falſe light and a wrong perſwaſion, and therefore a falſe and erronious opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion rather then a true faith. But whereſoeuer true reaſon appeareth indeed, there is a true light and a right perſwaſion, and ſo a true and right faith.</p>
                  <p>In ſo much, that where true reaſons be the fewer and the more weakelie apprehended, there is a weaker and feebler faith; but where they be the more, and the more ſtrongly apprehended, there is the ſtronger and fuller faith. And this is manifeſt by the different degrees of faith that are to be ſeene, euen in the true and ſincere ſeruants of God. For at the firſt imbracing of the ſauing doctrines of faith, the faithfull may be ignorant of many forcible reaſons that doe belong to the further ſtrengthening thereof, and that in thoſe very points, which yet in ſome meaſure already they vnderſtand &amp; beleeue; and in ſome other points of that diuine doctrine, they may be without knowledge altogether, v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:652:40"/>
                  <p>Whereby we may vnderſtand, that at our firſt calling to the faith of Chriſt, we may happily haue but ſome ſmall mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of knowledge, whereas by continuing in the ſtate of grace, as God doth lighten our mindes with a greater meaſure of knowledge in the myſteries of godlineſſe; ſo doth the ſtrength of our faith grow greater and greater. This is alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent by the diuerſities of the degrees of faith that were in the people of God, before the comming of Chriſt in the fleſh, and in <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, his immediate fore-runner, and in all wiſe hearted Chriſtians ſince his aſcention into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. For the people of God that liued before the incarnation of Chriſt, being further off from the appearing of the Sunne of righteouſneſſe, and hauing a darker Word, and obſcurer Sacraments, had by theſe meaner meanes a leſſe light, and ſo a weaker and a feebler faith. Whereas <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt, being neerer to the riſing of this glorious Sunne, both ſaw a greater light, and obtained a greater faith then in his time was to bee found among the children of women. And yet all ſuch Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans as are throughly inſtructed in the myſteries of the Goſpel, and ſo haue ſeene this Sunne after a ſort ſhining in his might, and reuealing himſelfe by a more plaine Word, and more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar Sacraments, haue receiued of God, as a greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of light, ſo alſo an higher degree of faith then <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt himſelfe was indued withall. <note place="margin">Matth. 11. 11</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And hereof it is, that the knowledge of the people of God that liued before the incarnation of Chriſt, is compared by Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> to a light ſhining in a darke place, or to the light <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 19.</note> of a ſmall ſtarre that ſhineth in the night. Whereas the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that is giuen to all wiſe-hearted Chriſtians, is likened to the greater light of the day ſtarre, yea to the light of the day it ſelfe. Wherefore it was not without cauſe, that by the ancient Fathers the faith of the Iewes is compared to a child in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, to corne in the graſſe, and to fruit in the bud and bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome: whereas the faith of all ſuch Chriſtians as are ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtructed in the doctrine of the Goſpel, is likened to a man in his ſtrength, to corne in the fulneſſe of the eare, and to fruit that is come to maturity and ripeneſſe. The which is ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:652:41"/> and an vndoubted a truth, that if any inſtance may bee giuen againſt the ſame in any ſingular perſon that liued vnder the Synagogue, as in <hi>Abraham, Moſes, Dauid,</hi> and the like, we may be bold to ſtand to this reſolution, that if in theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons there was any eminency of faith aboue that which is to be found in ſuch as liue vnder the Goſpell, the cauſe thereof was in the extraordinary working of the Spirit of God, which enabled them to vſe more diligence in their weaker meanes, and thereby aduanced them to greater gifts.</p>
                  <p>Now if againſt theſe things which haue beene deliuered, it be obiected, that faith doth not produce her actions by meanes of diſcourſe, but by the immediate operation and reuelation of the Spirit of God: albeit, this hath beene moſt abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confuted in all the former part of this Chapter: yet if it were not ſo, this one reaſon is fully ſufficient to conuince the ſame. For where is faith is that to the minde, which the eye is to the body, then it followeth, that as the eye doth not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend his obiect immediately, but as it is made conſpicuous by meanes of ſome bodily light: ſo faith which is the ſight of the ſoule, doth not apprehend truth, which is her generall obiect, vnleſſe it be made manifeſt by the light of rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>on, and meanes of diſcourſe. The which is ſo ſure and certaine a truth, that the Apoſtles themſelues who had the knowledge of all diuine and humane verities, neceſſary for ſuch as ſhould be teachers and inſtructers of the whole world; giuen vnto them, not by their owne labours and ſtuddy, but by the immediate reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit of God, yet had not this their knowledge without diſcourſe. As it is manifeſt by manner of handling and deciding the queſtion that was brought vnto them; which was, whether the workes of the Law were to be ioyned with faith in Chriſt, in the caſe of iuſtification and ſaluation: For it is recorded, that after the queſtion had beene debated among them with great diſputation and diſcourſe, the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Peter</hi> determined the ſame, and that not without the allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Act. 15. 7.</note> of many arguments and reaſons. As Saint <hi>Iames</hi> cauſed ſome clauſes to be added thereto, but not without the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of iuſt grounds for the ſame. So when the people of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:652:41"/> God were to be carried into captiuitie among the heathen, how did the Lord, fore-ſeeing that they ſhould be intiſed to Idolatry, ſtrengthen them in the Faith and Seruice of the true God, and arme them againſt all contrary perſwaſions, but by deliuering vnto them ſuch reaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>It is a truth confeſſed euen by ſome of the chiefe pillars of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that all the greateſt myſteries of Faith that are neceſſary to ſaluation, are plainely ſet down in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall Scriptures. Now I would demand whether theſe doctrines there deliuered, are treated and diſcourſed of there verbally, and in bare words onely, or really with ſufficient waight of ſound reaſon?

                  <p>The Doctrine of the Reſurrection, is ſtrange, abſurde, and almoſt, yea, altogether incredible in the iudgement of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man; but moſt wiſe and reaſonable vnto the Chriſtian. <note place="margin">Act. 17. 18.</note> The Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> in the fifteenth Chapter of the firſt Epiſtle to the Corinthians, proueth the ſame by many argu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments <note place="margin">

                  <p>Now that Chriſt is riſen, he prooueth it; firſt, for that his <note place="margin">Pſal. 16. 10. Rom. 9. 6.</note> reſurrection was fore-tolde in the word of God, the which that it ſhould not take effect, it was impoſſible. Secondly, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it by the teſtimony of thoſe that ſaw and handled his wounds that were made in his body, both before and after his death. Thirdly, he proueth it by the effect of Chriſts ſufferings and death, which was a full ſatisfaction for ſinne, and an aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of death, and therefore an introduction of a Reſurrection.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:652:43"/> For where there is no ſinne, there is no death, at leaſt, as it is a paine and puniſhment for ſin, but onely as it is an entrance vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life euerlaſting, which cannot be enioyed by our whole ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vnleſſe the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now the Apoſtle hauing thus proued the Reſurrection of the dead, by our Sauiours owne Reſurrection, hee procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to proue the ſame by diuers other arguments and reaſons: If (ſaith hee) there be no reſurrection, to a better eſtate aſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Yea, then let vs eate and drinke, for to morrow we ſhall die; and let vs labour to enioy the pleaſures of this life, if there be no reſurrection, nor hope to inioy better things in the world to come. But it is abſurd to imagine that the godly are in the worſt caſe, and that god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Epicures and Atheiſts are in the beſt: therefore it cannot be but there ſhall be a Reſurrection.</p>

Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, if theſe intelligible motiues will not prevaile with vs, the Apoſtle ſendeth vs to ſenſible things, that we may be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the cenſure of our ſenſe. For (ſaith he) if hearbes and graine after a ſort die in the Winter, and receiue life againe in the Spring; why may not the bodies of men doe ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe?</p>
                  <p>Surely Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> auoucheth, that he that quickneth, putrified and dead graine, by the which, mans life is maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this world, wil much more quicken man himſelf that he may liue with him for euer.

The earth, ſaith the Prophet, doth bring out her hearbes in the Spring, which were dead in the Winter; and why may ſhe not doe ſo with our bodies, at the generall iudgement? Wherefore (as our bleſſed Sauiour <note place="margin">Mar. 22. 29.</note> teſtifieth) all ſuch as are contrarie minded erre, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God, nor yet his conſtant and vnchangeable goodneſſe.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, the Scriptures doe plainelie teſtifie, that there ſhall be a Reſurrection of ſome of them that ſleepe in the duſt, to <note place="margin">Dan. 12. 2.</note> glorie; and of ſome to perpetuall ſhame and contempt. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlie, the power of God doth teach, that as he made all things out of a confuſed Chaos at the firſt, and gaue to each thing their diſtinct and ſeuerall beings; ſo he can doe the like againe, if al lthings ſhould returne to their former confuſion. Thirdlie, the conſtant and vnchangeable goodneſſe of God doth likewiſe aſſure vs of the truth hereof, For God is the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of all the ſpirituall children of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>

For a true friend loueth alwaies, much more God, the faithfulleſt friend of all friends. For if we be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull, yet he will not be vnfaithfull; he cannot denie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. <note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 4. 17</note> And therefore albeit, that ſin may ſuffer a full death, hee cauſeth the faithfull to ſuſtaine the anguiſh of a bodily death; yet he will raiſe them vp again to life, that they may euer liue with him, and inioy the fruit of his moſt conſtant and immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble goodneſſe and loue. For the bodies of the faithfull, as they haue beene co-workers with their ſoules in the Lords ſeruice, ſo they ſhall be ioynt poſſeſſors with them in that happineſſe and bliſſe wherewith he will reward all his faithfull ſeruants. Yea, whereas our bleſſed Sauiour Chriſt tooke vnto him an humane body as well as a humane ſoule, and ſuffered in the one as well as in the other, vndoubtedly the faithfull ſhall be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of their ſaluation and redemption, as well in the one, as in the other.</p>
                  <p>Now by theſe things that haue beene deliuered, it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:652:44"/> that holy Scripture giuen by diuine inſpiration, is able by ſuch ſufficient arguments and reaſons in all the myſteries of piety and godlineſſe, to teach truth, and to convince errour; <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 15.</note> that the man of God may be made thereby wiſe to ſaluation by faith in Chriſt, that is, that the ſincere and ſound Chriſtian, the true ſeruant of God may obtaine a wiſe faith, and ſo may be ſaued. Yea, that a profeſſor of any Religion ſhould volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily confeſſe that the points of his profeſſion cannot be iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by reaſon, but muſt be taken for truthes, without ſuch proofes as be without exception, argueth a fooliſh and a blinde ſophiſter, rather then a wiſe and a ſound diſcourſer; for to require and begge that things moſt controverſed and wholly doubted of ſhould be allowed of by the adverſary, and taken <note place="margin">

                  <p>And againe, Faith is ſuch an excellent knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus our Lord, that maketh the faithfull to eſteeme all other things as dung in reſpect thereof, which giueth them ſuch an aſſurance of their iuſtification &amp; glorification through Chriſt, <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 8.</note> that the high price thereof is the marke that they aime at in all their indeauours.</p>
                  <p>This pretious Faith (as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> calleth it) hath two <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 1.</note> ſingular effects iſſuing out of the ſame, which are, ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on began in this life, and an aſſurance of a full glorification in the life to come, The which becauſe they are the certaine ſignes and markes of a true faith; therefore the Apoſtle in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places doth deſcribe it by the ſame. True Faith (ſaith the Apoſtle) is a gift proper to Gods Elect, conſiſting in ſuch <note place="margin">Tit. 1. 1.</note> a knowledge of the truth, which is according to godlineſſe. And that we may know by what diuine truth in particular
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:652:45"/> faith breedeth godlineſſe, the Apoſtle hath ſet it downe elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, ſaying. We all behold as in a mirrour, the glory of the <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 18.</note> Lord with open face, and are changed into the ſame image from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord. We all (ſaith he) that are indued with the eye of faith, behold in Chriſt the mirrour and miracle of the Lords matchleſſe mercy, the glory of Gods goodneſſe and loue, he being neuer more glorious then in the ſame; with open face, in reſpect of the reuelation thereof, made in former times vnder obſcure types and ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, and by this cleere fight of the Lords moſt glorious loue in Chriſt, we are renewed into his image in righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe, according as it pleaſeth the Lord to begin the ſame by his Spirit, and to inlarge it alſo.</p>
                  <p>Now concerning the other effect of faith, the Apoſtle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth true faith by it alſo, ſaying, faith is the ground of things hoped for, and the euidence of things not ſeene. That is, faith is ſuch a gracious gift, as enableth the faithfull euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to behold the inuiſible things of God, and eſpecially his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable goodneſſe and loue; and giueth them alſo, in him a ſure ground-worke for the aſſurance of their full glorification, which as yet they inioy but in hope. Now in this Chapter we are to intreate of the definition of faith, and of the ſingular ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, in the two next following.</p>
                  <p>Aſſent doth follow apprehenſion, and therefore as a ſlight and a light apprehenſion begetteth opinion, which is an vnſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled and an vnſtable aſſent: ſo a ſure and certaine aſſent of the myſteries of godlineſſe ingendereth faith; that is, a reſolute and ſettled perſwaſion. For a ſettled aſſent proceeding from a well grounded knowledge, is all one with ſauing faith, and diuine wiſedome. As it may appeare in that when the Word of God is ſaid either ſeuerally, to giue the knowledge of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Lords people, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 77. or to giue faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 17. or to giue wiſedome vnto the ſimple, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 7. or ioyntly to bring to the vnity of faith, and of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Sonne of God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 13. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Iob.</hi> 6. 60. 7, 8. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 16. or to bring the vnderſtanding of wiſedome and knowledge, <hi>Prou.</hi> 1. 2. 9. 10. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Iac.</hi> 3. 13. or to

Which may alſo further appeare in this, that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God which calleth this diuine gift the full aſſurance of faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22. calleth it alſo the full aſſurance of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 2.</p>
                  <p>The minde and the vnderſtanding is the eye of the ſoule, and a ſure and ſettled knowledge of the myſteries of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or ſauing fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And hereof it is, that our bleſſed Sauiour not onely in his owne perſon calling men to repent and to beleeue the Goſpell, is ſaid to preach recouering of ſight to the blinde; <note place="margin">Luke 4. 18.</note> But alſo ſending out his Apoſtles to goe into the whole world and to preach the Goſpell to euery creature, is ſaid to ſend them out to open their eyes, that they might turne from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they <note place="margin">Act. 26. 18.</note> might receiue remiſſion of ſinnes, and inheritance among them that are ſanctified by faith in him.</p>
                  <p>And therefore the opening of the eyes of the faithfull where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they truly apprehend the myſteries of godlineſſe, is called <hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>And verily the true fight, apprehenſion, and knowledge of the Couenant of grace, and of all other diuine doctrines of the word of God, is (as <hi>Origen</hi> ſaith) a ſpeciall gift of God, proper to ſuch onely as are predeſtinated to this, euen to walke <note place="margin">

And ſo was Faith defined by the ancient Fathers, both Greeke and Latine, as Doctor <hi>Benfield</hi> teſtifieth in his third Chapter concerning ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Faith.</p>
                  <p>The Deuils and all obſtinate and impenitent ſinners, as they haue neither ſauing Faith, nor diuine wiſedome; ſo neither haue they any ſuch ſight, apprehenſion and knowledge of the diuine verities of Gods moſt holy Word, as cauſeth them to yeeld a ſure and certaine aſſent thereunto. The Deuils in their creation were Angels of light, and were ſanctified with the cleere knowledge of all diuine verities, but now they haue loſt <note place="margin">Iohn 17. 17. <hi>Chryſ. hom.</hi> 19. <hi>in Pſal.</hi> 118.</note> ſanctity by falling away from God the Father thereof, and from truth the mother and nurſe of the ſame. The Deuill (ſaith our Sauiour) abode not in truth, but is a liar and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of lies; he made choice to miſconceiue of God, that he <note place="margin">Iohn 8. 44.</note> was vniuſt, hard, and cruell, and he is ſo blinded and hardened therein, that he cannot, nor will not be remooued from the ſame. As it may appeare in that he refuſed to ſtand to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of our Sauiour Chriſt, laying euer to his charge iniuſtice, and cruelty: ſaying, What haue we to do with thee thou Ieſus of Nazareth? Art thou come to torment vs before the <note place="margin">Matth. 8. 29.</note> time?</p>
                  <p>And verily, from that which preſerued at the firſt, and ſtill preſerueth the elect Angels, (as <hi>Iſidore</hi> teſtifieth) that is, from the viſion, and contemplation, and ſettled perſwaſion of all thoſe diuine perfections that be in God, eſpecially of his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and endleſſe goodneſſe and loue: the reprobate Angels fell, and wholly depriued themſelues thereof, and therefore doe not now know and acknowledge, that God is righteous, gracious, and good, nor honour him by aſcribing vnto him theſe glorious perfections.</p>
                  <p>Now as the old Serpent hath thus inuenomed himſelfe, ſo
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:652:47"/> hath he with the ſame poiſon infected the nature of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue,</hi> &amp; of al vs which by ordinary generation deſcend from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: For he perſwaded our firſt parents, not only that God was not good vnto them, for that he forbad them the vſe of the fruit of one of the trees of Paradiſe, and withheld from them the knowledge of good and euill, leſt thereby they ſhould become as Gods; but alſo that he was not righteous and true, and that the euils wherewith he threatned them, if they brake his Commandement, ſhould not come vpon them.</p>
                  <p>By which miſſe perſwaſion, they miſconceiuing of Gods goodneſſe and righteouſneſſe, were hardened with all their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity in this miſconceit.

They beleeue not Gods goodneſſe, but ſcorne the faithfull (as the wiſe man teſtifieth) that doe the ſame, thinking it to be a thing impoſſible that any can haue the aſſurance of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly loue. They beleeue not Gods iuſtice, for then they <note place="margin">Sap. 2. 13.</note> would auoid ſinne, if it were but to eſcape the dreadfull execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods vengeance due to the ſame. Our conſcience (ſaith Saint <hi>Cyprian)</hi> would be afraid if it did beleeue, but becauſe it <note place="margin">

And this commeth to paſſe for that the word of God is of the one, but ſuperficially receiued, and therefore at the laſt withereth and dieth; Whereas in the other it taketh deepe roote, and therefore liueth and flouriſheth in them continually; In the one it poſſeſſeth as it were the vnfenſed ſuburbes of their ſenſes, and the weake ſconſes of their phantaſies; but in the other it ſeateth it ſelfe in the well-defenced Cities of their ſoules, and in the vnconquerable Caſtle of a good conſcience.

                  <p>As if the minde reſolue, that our chiefeſt happines conſiſteth in the plentifull poſſeſſion and fruition of all earthly profits and pleaſures, then will the will and affections be wholly ſet vpon earthly things; but if it reſolue that our higheſt happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and our chiefeſt good conſiſteth in our communion with God, and in the cleere manifeſtation of his loue in Chriſt, then will our hearts be lifted vp to God, and fixed on Chriſt, and ſettled vpon heauen and heauenly things.

                  <p>Wherefore as all carnall Goſpellers and looſe Libertines, ſo our Romane Catholikes are greatly deceiued, in that they thinke that a ſauing and iuſtifying faith may ſtand with raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſinnes; for then ſhould the ſelfe-ſame perſons at the ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame time be the children of God in reſpect of their mindes, ſanctified with the knowledge of the truth, and with ſauing faith; and the children of the Deuill in their wils being pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with dominering ſins, but where ſauing faith getteth the ſure and ſafe poſſeſſion of the minde, it not only expelleth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity out of the caſtle of the vnderſtanding, but alſo caſteth out all ſinne and iniquity out of the forts of the will and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, that they ſhall no longer rule and raigne there.

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:652:53"/> by the teſtimony of God himſelfe, ſet downe by the Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> in moſt direct words to that purpoſe; I will <note place="margin">Ier. 32. 40.</note> (ſaith the Lord) make an euerlaſting Couenant with them, (meaning his faithfull ones vnder the time of grace) that I will not turne away from them to doe them good, but I will put my feare in their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me. So then now vnder the Couenant of grace, diuine grace is not ſo offered to the faithfull, that they may either chuſe or refuſe it if they will, but thereby they are made both willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it at the firſt, and reſolute alſo to perſeuere therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, euen to the end: and therefore by the Spirit of God, they are called trees which ſhall not ceaſe from yeelding fruit. <note place="margin">Ier. 17. 8.</note> Whereby it is manifeſt, that grace lightning the vnderſtanding with a true faith, doth ſanctifie the will with all other vertues, and eſtabliſh it alſo with conſtancy and perſeuerance.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore a well-grounded knowledge of the myſteries of godlineſſe, diuine wiſdome, and ſauing faith doe neuer goe alone, but take their traine with them, and are alwaies accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with all other diuine and heauenly vertues. And thus much concerning the neceſſary combination of ſauing faith, with all other diuine vertues.

                  <argument>
                     <p>The diuine doctrine of the Chriſtian faith doth giue to the ſincere imbracers thereof a ſauing faith, and an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance thereby of Gods fauour and loue, and of eternall happineſſe and bleſſedneſſe.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THat which all erronious profeſſions doe promiſe, that the Goſpell of Chriſt doth performe, euen a ſure faith, and a faithfull aſſurance of the fauour and loue of God, and of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:652:53"/> eternall happineſſe and bleſſedneſſe. For herein is reuealed the Couenant of grace, grounded vpon a ſtrong foundation, euen vpon him that is <hi>Immanuell,</hi> God with vs, a moſt powerfull Reconciler of men vnto God, and a moſt gracious procurer of Gods fauour and loue. For mans ſinne being committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the infinite maieſty of the moſt glorious Deity, could not be done away but by an infinite ſatisfaction; and Gods loue and euerlaſting happineſſe conſiſting therein, being bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of an inualuable worth, could not haue beene purchaſed, but by an inualuable price. Now this infinite ſatisfaction, and inualuable price could not haue beene tendred but by ſuch an one that was true man ioyned in one perſon to the true God, that ſo he might be a meet Mediatour betweene God and man.</p>
                  <p>And ſo he himſelfe teſtifieth, ſaying, I am the way, the truth, <note place="margin">Iohn 14. 6.</note> and the life, no man commeth vnto the Father but by me: It is then by Chriſts meanes that wee beleeue in God, and haue an aſſurance of his fauour and loue. For to him God gaue after his ſhamefull death, which he ſuffered for our ſins, a glorious reſurrection; as an ample teſtification of his full ſatisfaction made for them all, and of his victorious conqueſt ouer death, that ſo we might haue faith and hope in God. Wherefore if <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 21.</note> God hath plainly opened vnto vs the worke of our redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and reconciliation wrought by Chriſt, which is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Couenant of grace, wherein God offereth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be a gracious God, and a louing Father to all ſuch as imbrace it with a true faith; it cannot be, but if that with a true faith we apprehend this gracious Couenant, we ſhould reſt thereby throughly perſwaded of the Lords ineſtimable fauour and loue towards vs.</p>
                  <p>Now that the vndoubted truth therof may euidently appeare, let vs obſerue theſe three circumſtances: Firſt, the time when this aſſurance is giuen: Secondly, the meanes whereby it is wrought: Thirdly, the witneſſes that giue euidence to the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and infallibility thereof. Now concerning the firſt, when God by the light of the Goſpel doth open our eies, &amp; make vs to behold the light of his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance ſhining vnto vs in Chriſt
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:652:54"/> Ieſus, and thereby doth not only informe our vnderſtanding, but alſo reforme our will and affections, euen then in ſome meaſure he giueth vnto vs this comfortable aſſurance, that he hath admitted vs among the number of his children, and hath matriculated vs into the Vniuerſity of his Saints, and hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred our names into his booke of life.</p>
                  <p>For that which our bleſſed Sauiour auouched of <hi>Zacheus,</hi> when he willingly receiued by loue Chriſts perſon into his houſe, and his doctrine by faith into his heart: This day is ſaluation come to this houſe, for as much as this man is become <note place="margin">Luke 19. 9.</note> the ſonne of Abraham; that is to be auerred of all perſons whatſoeuer, that readily imbrace the faith that was in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi> ſeeing all ſuch as haue their hearts purged by faith, are <note place="margin">Rom. 4 12.

Now (ſaith Saint <hi>Iohn)</hi> we are the ſonnes of God, euen as many as by an <note place="margin">1 Iohn 3. 2.</note> effectuall calling are brought to a wiſe and vnderſtanding faith, and to an holy and vpright life.

                  <p>In the which very place (that we may come to our ſecond circumſtance) Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> aduiſeth the perſon that is made an holy and iuſt man, to take for the opener of this myſtery of his ſaluation, the Spirit making him righteous and iuſt; and thereby teſtifying to his ſpirit that he is the child of God. For (ſaith he) who is a iuſt man, but he that being beloued of God loueth him againe? Which commeth not to paſſe, but by the Spirit of God, reuealing by ſaith the eternall promiſe of God for his ſaluation to come, the which reuelation, (that is, the ground or meanes of the which reuelation) is nothing elſe but

                  <p>So then when the Apoſtle auoucheth, that the Spirit of God beareth witneſſe to our ſpirits that we are the children <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 16.</note> of God, that he doth (ſaith Saint <hi>Bernard)</hi> by nothing elſe but by the infuſion of ſpirituall grace, whereby the deedes of the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>For whereas God hath promiſed to be a gracious God, and louing Father to all ſuch as truſt in him, loue him, and feare him, and are carefull to obſerue his Lawes, and are truly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull for their daily tranſgreſſions and ſinnes; How can it otherwiſe be, but that the faithfull hauing by their dutifull conuerſing with God in the holy exerciſes of hearing his holy Word, and of prayer, obtained theſe graces in ſome ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient meaſure? How can it, I ſay, otherwiſe be, but that thereby they ſhould be certainly perſwaded that God is their louing and gracious God, and that they are his beloued peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? For it is impoſſible that the promiſes of God made to his people concerning this matter, ſhould be void and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out effect. Walke (ſaith the Lord) in my Statutes and keepe <note place="margin">Ex. 20. 19.</note> my iudgements, and do them, and ſanctifie my Sabbaoths, and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:652:55"/> they ſhall be a ſigne betweene me and you, that ye may know that I am your God. Of the certainty and euidency of the truth thereof, the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo confident, that he appealeth to euery faithfull mans experience among the Romans concerning the ſame; ſaying, Know ye not that to <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 16.</note> whomſoeuer ye giue your ſelues as ſeruants to obey, his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants ye are, to whom ye obey, whether it be of ſinne vnto death, or of obedience vnto righteouſneſſe? The faithfull then being well witting to their own hearts that they haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen themſelues to God, and are carefull to performe the works of faith, loue, holineſſe, and righteouſneſſe according vnto the rule of Gods word, in obedience vnto God, doe ſo throughly know hereby that they do an acceptable ſeruice vnto God, and that they are his obedient ſeruants, that they doe greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce therein with the Apoſtle; This is our reioycing, euen the <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 12.</note> teſtimony of our conſcience, that in ſimplicity and godly pureneſſe, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now if it be obiected that the faithfull know not their owne hearts, nor the true nature of theſe diuine graces, nor the right notes and markes of the holy workes that proceed from them, and therefore albeit they are indued with theſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and performe theſe works, yet they cannot know that they are the ſeruants of God; We anſwer, firſt, that that obiection is in direct tearmes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For the faithfull know that ſuch an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion and knowledge of Chriſt, as cauſeth all things to be as dung to them in reſpect thereof, is a ſure ſigne of a ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied minde, lightened with the cleare ſight of a true faith.

                  <p>For as a true friend among men, doth beſtow ſuch fauours and gifts vpon him whom he intirely and tenderly loueth, as the receiuer vnderſtandeth what they are and their worth alſo, that ſo by manifeſting his great kindneſſe he may winne mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and reciprocall loue: ſo God the friend of friends, giueth his ſpirituall graces vnto all thoſe whom he hath loued in Chriſt, and choſen in him before the foundation of the world, and maketh them to vnderſtand what theſe his principall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings are, and the end why he giueth them, euen to aſſure them of his fatherly fauour and loue. Yea, he maketh them ſenſible of this gracious worke of his Spirit in their owne hearts, when he effecteth the ſame by the powerfull operation of his owne holy Spirit, and worketh a true ſenſe and feeling thereof in the receiuers themſelues, as it hath already beene declared in the opening of the ſecond queſtion of the firſt part of this treatiſe, and ſhall bee further cleared alſo in the ſecond part here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.

                  <p>In the Law (ſaith our Sauiour) it is written that the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony <note place="margin">Iohn 8. 17.</note> of two men is true. Of what an vndoubted truth then is that thing, which is witneſſed by a ſanctified conſcience

Now if the witneſſe of a ſanctified conſcience be of ſuch validity, which yet is but an humane teſtimony, what is the witneſſe of God himſelfe? Now this is the witneſſe of God (ſaith the Apoſtle) that not <note place="margin">1 Iohn 5. 9.</note> onely he hath giuen vnto vs eternall life, but alſo that he hath by his Spirit giuen vnto vs our faich to teſtifie the ſame to our owne ſoules, and that to this end, that we might know that we haue eternall life, and that we might beleeue <hi>(viz.</hi> by a faith daily growing ſtronger and ſtronger) in the name of the Sonne of God.</p>
                  <p>The which thing cannot be but effectually wrought, if the faithfull would daily and duly conſider, that the promiſe of bleſſedneſſe made by Chriſt to all that beleeue, was by God deliuered not onely by word of mouth, but alſo by an oath, <note place="margin">Iohn 5. 24.</note> and after the ſame maner was redeliuered to Chriſt, and that to this end, that by two immutable things, wherein it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 17.</note> that God ſhould lie, we might haue ſtrong conſolation; and not only ſo, but alſo was ſet downe vnder his own hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine and againe in all the bookes of the old and new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and further yet, was ratified and confirmed by many feales of diuers Sacraments.</p>

                  <p>There be two things that hinder this comfortable aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in all the faithfull more or leſſe, eſpecially in the time of ſome grieuous tentation. As firſt, the ſmall meaſure of faith, and other ſpirituall graces, and the great ſtrength of their earthly and carnall affections. And ſecondly, the remnants of diſtruſtfull feare of vtterly falling away from God, cauſed by their manifold and daily fals; but the ſmall meaſure of faith, and of other graces of ſanctification, ought not to hinder the aſſurance of the faithfull; becauſe a little faith is a true faith, aſwell as a great faith; ſeeing more or leſſe doth not change <note place="margin">

The Church of <hi>Thiatyra</hi> had but a little ſtrength, yet ſhe was accepted with God aſwell as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches that had greater: For workes of pietie are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:652:59"/> with God according to that a man hath, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <note place="margin">2 Cor. 8. 12. Matth. 13. 23.</note> to that he hath not. The ground that brought forth fruit thirtie ſold, is commended for good ground as well as that which brought forth a great deale more. And the ſeruant <note place="margin">Matth. 25. 23.</note> that gained two talents, is praiſed by his maſter as well as he that gained fiue. For God will not deſpiſe the day of ſmall <note place="margin">Zach. 4. 10.</note> things, neither will our meeke and milde Sauiour Chriſt break the bruiſed reed, nor quench the ſmoaking flax. <note place="margin">Matth. 12. 20.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreouer, when the Lord doth promiſe that he will be a gracious God to all that beleeue, repent, and returne vnto him, loue him, and feare him, and walke in his waies, he doth not reſpect the perfection of theſe graces, nor the worth of the workes that proceed from them, but theſe promiſes are all founded vpon the worthineſſe of Chriſt, who is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation <note place="margin">Act. 3. 26. Gal 3. 18. 2 Cor. 1. 20. Epheſ. 1. 6.</note> of the Couenant, and vpon the perfection and merit of his obedience: For all the promiſes of God are in him, yea, and in him, Amen. And all the faithfull are accepted in him as all their diuine graces, and fruitfull workes are ſpirituall ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices well pleaſing to God by the ſweet odour of the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 5. Apocal. 8. 3.</note> of Chriſt. The ſmall meaſure then of faith, and of all other graces of ſanctification, ought not to diſcourage the faithfull, nor yet their ſins of ignorance and infirmitie; ſeeing the ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <note place="margin">Leuit. 4 2. Numb. 15. 24.</note> vnder the Law appointed by God himſelfe, being ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes of the ſacrifice of Chriſt, do aſſure them that they ſhall be fully pardoned by the perfection &amp; merit of the ſacrifice of Chriſt. Yea if any one truly repent, and be heartily ſorry for his ſinnes that haue beene willingly and wittingly committed, yet there is a ſacrifice of expiation and reconciliation appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">Leuit. 6. 1. Ezech. 18. 22.</note> euen for all ſuch ſinnes, and a promiſe of pardon to all ſuch ſinners. For as no ſinne is veniall, if it continually pleaſe; ſo no ſinne is mortall if it heartily diſpleaſe. And albeit ſinne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in the faithfull as long as they liue, yet if godly ſorrow woundeth it, a godly death ſhall vtterly deſtroy it: And if in any one, ſinne be deadly wounded, and at the laſt vtterly deſtroyed, how can it worke ſuch a perſons deſtruction?</p>
                  <p>Now albeit the faithfull many times fall, yet they neuer vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly fall away, ſeeing the <hi>Lord ordereth a good mans going, and</hi>

For God hath bound himſelfe vnder the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant of grace, that he will not leaue his faithfull ſeruants to ſtand or fall at their owne choice, but that hee will ſtabliſh their wils by his grace, that they ſhall neuer will and reſolue to continue perpetually in ſinne, and vtterly to fall away from God, as it is deliuered by the Prophet <hi>Ieremy.</hi>

                  <p>A <hi>Romiſh</hi> Catholicke muſt liue in feare and ſuſpence of the full pardon of his ſinnes by faith in Chriſts bloud, and yet if he receiue abſolution from a <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſt, or a Pardon from the Pope, he muſt reſt aſſured thereof: A <hi>Romiſh</hi> Catholicke muſt not reſt aſſured of his iuſtification and ſaluation by the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, imputed vnto him by the free and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerued grace and mercy of God, but if he be carefull to fulfill the Law of God and the rules of their religious orders, hee

                  <p>But to erect ſo great a building as is the aſſurance of our iuſtification and ſaluation vpon ſo weake and rotten foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is in truth preſumptuous and intollerable folly and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.

                  <p>The faithfull that liued before the Incarnation of Chriſt, (as the Apoſtle ſaith) ſed vpon the ſame heauenly Manna and <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 3.</note> bread of life as we now doe; but they did not eate the fleſh of Chriſt with their bodily mouthes, neither then doe the faithfull ſo now. And verily, whereas by the miniſtery of the word and baptiſme in our new birth and inchoation of our ſanctification, we receiue not Chriſt after a bodily manner, but after a ſpirituall; and yet are thereby regenerated and quickened to an holy life: Why then, is not the growth and increaſe of our ſanctification by the miniſtery of the ſame word and Euchariſt, wrought and accompliſhed after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner?</p>

It is euident that ſinne being an offence committed againſt the infinite Maieſty of the moſt glorious Deity, requireth a ſatisfaction no leſſe then infinite. Now who could ſo much as imagine that God being ſo grieuouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked, and ſo highly offended with man, ſhould ſend his owne Sonne to become man, that in mans nature he might ſuffer death for mans deliuery from death and condemnation?

                  <p>Surely the Goſpell wherein this worke is reuealed, is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine and ſupernaturall, exceeding all humane and naturall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, and could not be reuealed but by him, that could worke beyond the power of nature.

For (as <hi>Lactantius</hi> ſaith) Let humane wiſedome ſtretch it ſelfe to the vttermoſt, yet it can but cauſe men to couer their ſinnes, it cannot enable them to caſt them out, whereas the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:652:78"/> Goſpell, which is the Law of the Spirit of Life, not onely freed Saint <hi>Paul</hi> from the Law of ſinne and death, but alſo conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 2.</note> the world, and that in ſhort time from infidelity to faith, from ſinne to righteouſneſſe, from Satan to God; albeit it was moſt mightily reſiſted, not onely with all the wiſedome and learning, but alſo with all the power and authority of all the wiſeſt and greateſt men of the world: and therefore it cannot be denyed, but that it is the moſt mighty and powerfull word of the moſt mighty and powerfull God.

For the queſtion here handled by the Apoſtle, is not how we may be deliuered from the graue, or from a temporall death, and may be made partakers of a temporall life; but how we may be deliuered from that death that is indured in hell, and how we may be made pertakers of aeternall life and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe in the Kingdome of heauen. For obſerue the diſcourſe of the Apoſtle; The Law (ſaith he) ſaith; ſinne not at all, and thou needeſt not at all feare (not the graue but) hell, the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon appointed for the puniſhment of ſinne: and fulfill all righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, and thou needeſt not to doubt of thy comming to heauen, where righteouſneſſe dwelleth and raigneth for euer. But the righteouſnes performed for vs by Chriſt, &amp; obtained by faith, ſaith, <hi>No more doubt of thine aſcenſion into heauen then of Chriſts aſcenſion; nor of thy deliuerance from hell, then of Chriſts deliuerance: ſeeing whatſoeuer Chriſt hath done, he hath done it for them that are vnited vnto him by a true faith, and thereby haue full intereſt both in his ſufferings, and in his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, which he hath endured and performed for them.</hi>

                  <p>Now then let me demand of any faithfull man, what greater aſſurance he can haue of his aſcenſion into heauen, then the aſcenſion of Chriſt, who aſcended thither, there to prepare a place for all his, as he himſelfe plainely teſtifieth, <hi>Ioh,</hi> 14. 2. So vpon the like conſequence may it alſo be demaunded, what greater aſſurance can a faithfull man haue for his deliuerance from hell, then this, that Chriſt being in hell before the grand executioner of the Lords vengeance for ſinne, in the priſon that was ordayned for thoſe debtors, that were no way able to make ſatisfaction, that Chriſt, I ſay, that was made ſinne for vs and our ſurety, and a debter in our roome, was deliuered from

                  <p>For to ſay that God ordained all to life, but altered his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree vpon their alteration, is to rob God either of his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable goodneſſe, or of his vncontrouleable might and power.

                  <p>For God made man according to his owne image, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled into his ſoule all diuine and heauenly graces, and gaue him hability to continue therein, and left him to his owne choice, to ſtand or to fall at his owne free will; but he did not ſo ſtabliſh him with his grace, that he could not become wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to fall away, becauſe he was no way indebted vnto him, and bound to performe vnto him that fauour.</p>
                  <p>Much leſſe when all mankinde fell away in <hi>Adam,</hi> was God bound to reſtore all, but ſome according to his owne good pleaſure he calleth by his Spirit and Word to the eſtate of Grace, and giueth them faith to embrace his endleſſe good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in Chriſt Ieſus, &amp; ſo maketh them partakers of euerlaſting bleſſednes: &amp; other he iuſtly leaueth in their own wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, whereinto they are fallen by their owne fault, and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them to periſh in their owne ſinnes.

                  <p>Vndoubtedly, as God in his eternall Counſell, did appoint that bodily diſeaſes ſhould come into the world, to detect on the one ſide the weakeneſſe of the creature, and his folly in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing many things to his hurt and deſtruction, that are of themſelues profitable for his preſeruation; and on the other ſide to make manifeſt his owne wiſedome and goodneſſe, in that he hath prouided great variety of helpes to man, both for the preuenting, and alſo for the full curing of all manner of noiſome maladies: ſo did hee in like manner decree that hee would permit man to caſt himſelfe into many ſpirituall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes,
